## How to Use

1. **Share Quickly** – Send the raw HTML or take screenshots/GIFs for stakeholders who need to “see it” fast.
2. **Refine in Figma** – Use these as visual guardrails when building higher-fidelity components in Figma or Framer.
3. **Gather Feedback** – Append comments directly in the HTML (annotated sections are labelled) or mirror the layout inside your design tool to enable collaborative comments.
4. **Handoff to Engineering** – The HTML mirrors the layout, spacing, and Lego palette tokens that engineers will expect when translating into React/Tailwind.

> All colours meet WCAG 2.2 AA for text contrast against their assigned backgrounds. Use the CSS variables as your single source of truth.
